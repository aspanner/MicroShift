# MicroShift-Controll-Scripts
this repo is specific to our edge scenario where AI is monitoring the movement of robots using MicroShift and Podman.
the control scripts setup the environment called 'guise', named after our partner GuiseAI.

Furthermore the image build is moved from Ubuntu to Enterprise ready Red Hat Universal Base Image builds.
